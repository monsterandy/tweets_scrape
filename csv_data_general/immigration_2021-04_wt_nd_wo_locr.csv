#DV2017_2020 https://t.co/01uABdvorG","Dear President Joe Biden

CC Vice President Mrs Kamela Harris House Representatives US Senate

We Iranians who were the winners of the Diversity Lottery for the years 2017 2020

are requesting your reconsideration for a second chance to process our cases

We have been invited for interviews by the US immigration entity and have accepted all

costs including medical and travel expenses in hopes of living in the democratic

country of the USA and achieving prosperity

Unfortuaately we were banned from our US visa due to the unjust Presidential

Proclamation PP 9645 in the previous US Administration which targeted Iranian

nationality and our religion This has caused us a lot of frustrations and sadness Some

of us had traveled to other countries and have even put our lives and careers on pause

in order to obtain proper documentation for this lottery Our children were so excited to

grow up in America and to obtain a strong education an only chance for a lot of them

President and Vice President we hope that you consider our cases We include many

professional individuals among the winners of the diversity lottery  architects

doctors researchers etc We believe that we can be highly productive members of the

American society and further strengthen the economy given the chance

We appreciate your timely action on this issue

Respectfully

Awaiting Iranian Lottery winners

Epidemiologist Dr David Fisman provides expert advice to help guide govt

Last year fisman accepted money from an Ontario teachers union to

argue against the governments September school reopening plansa

conilict of interest that he did not disclose until reported on by the Toronto

Sun Though Fisman maintains no wrongdoing the Ontario College of

Physicians and Surgeons guidelines clearly state A conflict of interest can

The guide ls aimed at unethical relationships with industry and as first

Fisman was also paid by 2 vaccine companies Pfizer and Astra Zeneca

representing a potentially dangerous situation where public interests are

compromised for a duly owed Throughout Covid19 Fisman and the

Ontario govt have maintained a proleckdown stance largely based on

fearinducing and inaccurate models On Jan 12 Premier Doug Ford wildly

projected up fo 20000 new cases per day by midFeb as of Feb 14 there

were only 981 new cases With such misguided fear and one of the mast

severe lockdowns in North America in place is it coincidental that Ontarios

vaccine program is in hyperdrive with radio ads alerting residents to stay

home until they get a vaccine7

With just 788 deaths under age 60 with or from Covid19 or 38 of

Canadas 20913 deaths the most vuinerable population to protect has

been clear since the March 2020 elderly with underlying conditions

With financial ties to multiple vested interests it must be asked how much of

Dr Fismans guidance is based on the epidemiological data2

Since June 2017 Canadas Human Rights Act has

prohibited discrimination against gender identity

and gender expression Correctional Service

Canadas policy had been to approve transfer toa

womens prison of a male inmate identifying as a

woman only after bottom surgery Shortly after

Bill C16 was passed a simple affirmation of

identity as a woman no surgery no hormones

just a pronoun change became sufficient to re

quest and usually get a transfer

Gender identity has become a sacrosanct principle

in Canada with trans inclusivity privileged over

sexbased security claims Transwomen with a

history of violent crime are not disqualified for

transfer even though we have no evidence that an

individuals psychopathology disappears with a

change of gender identity A serial pedophile a

serial sex offender a contract killer a child killer

a murderer All have been approved for Canadian

womens prisons or halfway houses

Why won’t you discipline your MP’s?

Gaslighting your MP’s keep spewing is inciting people to ignore COVID restrictions

Your MP’s are killing Canadians.

Your silence is not leadership.

It is cowardice for you to do nothing.

comes to their ministries Thats exactly what were doing

In this case here Madam Chair what am focused on and what our

entire defence team is focused on is making sure we look at the current situation and find

ways to create the culture change that everybody on this committee and all of us want I

look forward to the recommendations from this committee and all members of Parliament

because ultimately this is what When we formed government we wanted to make sure

we created an inclusive environment for all Canadians not just in the Canadian Armed

Forces but ail across Canadaz This is something we took very seriously

before we came into government

Were working aggressively to make the changes We know theres a lot more work to do

but we want to continue doing that work More importantly we need to be able to hear

from the experts We need to hear from the survivors We need to hear from the women of

the Canadian Armed Forces both serving and retired Thats whats going to allow us to

create that culture change We want to move as aggressively as possible but ultimately

our objective is always going to be zero tolerance

I have been in Pakistan in 2016 and my cousin back in Canada was

suffering from serious health issues The prev consultant told me that

mysponsorship isnt possible and I had made my mind

about it until 1 met Junaid Salik from Euro Consultant

Let me tell you straightaway that he not only filed my case got it approved and

also got me visit Visa in the mid of the process for 5 years multi entry because of

which I went to visit my daughter last year Getting visitor visa when the case is

up has been impossible thing but thankfully with his guidance I got it

If you want a trustworthy and reliable immigration consultancy

then there isnt anyone better than Euro

Keep it up Junaid Bro and keep helping and guiding

others in the best way you doing

So when Trump cut off aid from the Golden Triangle

Honduras Guatemala El Salvador in 2017 because he

wanted those governments to control the migrant issue

on their end it actually worked But When the aid started

back up the migrant issue increased again So it really

sounds like a lot of political corruption going on down

there and the US administrations would like to get to the

stem of it but these CA elites arent having it but the

people are living in very poor conditions So my question

is this since America is getting these countries

migrants should America go in and do something about

it Ya know you always hear about America going into a

country and bullying it for its resources and

governments but here should America go in with the us

military and humanitarian aid and social organizaitno

and money and try and help stabilize an economy to fix

the migrant issue I feel like America done this before

and it failed but dont quote me on this

Why choose a Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultant

when I can do it myself

rN

Immigration matters are very important and its

advisable to always seek legal advice and help for your case

to ensure that you are aware of all of your options and nothing

is le out in your case You can take a risk and try to represent

yourself in some simple cases however that is still a gamble

and it is not worth it Immigration is very complex and laws are

always changing hence the need for an RCIC

The world isa dog park

People who dont mingle with other people outside of their social

ethnic religious economic political or peer groups are like dogs

that grow up without ever having been socialized with other dogs

they tend to be skittish around the unfamiliar and react to other

dogs with hesitation suspicion and barking

Socializing dogs is recommended for good reasons Not least of

which is that they exist more harmoniously with other dogs

This doesnt just apply to dogs The world is a dog park

Tertiary Education as a Pathway to

Protection

2ST

Globally approximately 30 of the worlds tertiaryaged

population are enrolled and studying in university In contrast

only 3 of the worlds refugee population has access to higher

education This gap is striking particularly as the benefits of

education specifically higher education are wellknown

Tertiary education has the potential to offer countless benefits in

countries of displacement transit and destination By each of

these countries playing their part a percentage of the refugee

population may be able to attain significantly improved

outcomes
