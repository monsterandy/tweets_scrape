It's misinformation.  @JamesTeitsma #mbpoli #cdnpoli https://t.co/PUdHjWzHJq,"about Manitobas Low positive test rate

6x lower than early April in Manitoba

response to

40x lower than hotspots in USA

Covid19

Just 3 in 10000 of Manitobans

have been infected 003

 Thats lower than almost every jurisdiction

in North America with over a million inhabitants

Virtually no community spread

Almost all recent cases are related

to travelers and their close contacts

Less deaths from Covid19 than

an average flu season

Manitoba averages 1854 flu deaths annually

The steps we are taking are

 Lets all be sure to wash our hands

working

avoid touching our faces stay physically

distant and stay home when we are sick

the Montreal Gazette he was a passionate advocate of the

troops and became a confidante of Prime Minister Robert

Borden I always held him in the warmest affection Border

recalled In peacetime Tom served as 1922 president of the

Ottawa Press Gallery and cofounded the Canadiana news

Subjects PLEASE READ conflict of interest screen for Ms Katle Telford

Hello

Tam writing to inform you of Ms Katie Telfords decision to voluntarily put in place a conflict of interest screen as a result of a new position held by her husband Mr Rob Silver Ms Silver has

accepted the position of Senior Director Corporate Strategic Initiatives Public Affairs at MCAP which according to its website is a Canadian independent mortgage financing company

The Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner has advised that no conflict screen is required in the circumstances However out of an abundance of caution Ms Telford has decided

to implement a voluntary sereen to ensure that she is not exposed to any real or perceived conflict of interest If you have any questions with respect to the application or scope of the screen please

communicate with the Deputy Clerk Catherine Blewett who has accepted to be its administrator Note that matters if any which Ms Telford will be screened out must be referred to Marci

Surkes Executive Director of Policy and Cabinet Affairs

We are requesting your diligent cooperation in applying the voluntary screea and ensuring that Ms Telford is abstained from any participation in any matters or decisions relating to MAP

Other matters that may arise could be added for which you would be notified

In addition if a matter does come to Ms Telfords attention involving MCAP that could further her husbands private interest note that she is required to recuse herself and contact the Office of the

Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner to report the recusal within 60 days that the recusal took place

The PM told Cdns he 'will not' use prorogation &amp; promised to change the rules to bring an end to the 'undemocratic practice.'

violent responses to violence and oppression including economic

measures such as government sanctions consumer boycotts

Paul would not say whether she endorses that position only that

she continues to advocate for dialogue as the preferred means

for the resolution of the conflict

She said she supports a twostate solution in the IsraelPalestine

conflict opposes Israels plan to annex parts of the West Bank and

feels dialogue is the only solution to the strife that has marked

international relations work that open dialogue is the only way to

settle deepseated conflicts These would include the 50year

struggle in Colombia the genocide in Rwanda and the decades

indulge in unethical practices who take advantage

of their office and power to hide the truth

There needs to be a body put in place who can

PRESS RELEASE RightNow congratulates new

Conservative Party of Canada leader Erin OToole

At the beginning of the campaign it was generally

accepted in the media that Peter MacKay was going to

be coronated so it is impressive that Erin and his team

were able to secure this victory Given that a record

number of members cast a ballot in the largestever

leadership race in Canadian history as well as how

well our endorsed candidate Leslyn Lewis did it is

abundantly clear that social conservatives are not the

stand by while they tear down our history and monuments

No nation leader or human race is perfect While we still

have work to do our world has made tremendous progress

I want my daughters and son to learn all of our history bad

or good Thats how we make progress as a society

Governments across this nation and in these cities must

take steps to reinin this violent protesters They serve no

identifiable good to the cause of justice and equality

We must strengthen our law enforcement and reform where

needed but not defund the police or defame those who

bear enormous risks to themselves and their families to

keep all of us our people and communities safe

They deserve our respect praise and not victimization

The man who help found this country and became our

nations first Prime Minister deserve nothing but our thanks

Its one of the most damning quotations ever attributed to Macdonald

And yet in the parliament record its immediately followed by an even

more damning comment as the Liberal opposition benches accuse

Macdonald of not starving Indians enough

No doubt the Indians will bear a great degree of starvation before

they will work and so long as they are certain the Government will

come to their aid they will not do much for themselves said David

Mills who had served as minister of the interior under the Liberal

the Health Authorities to identify a small group of people who may have been exposed and all of them are either self

isolating selfmonitoring or have undergone testing which so far have come back negative We are watching the

situation closely and urge everybody not to take any risks and remain vigilant The Provincial government puts a lot of

emphasis on selfdiscipline and ones personal sense of responsibility I trust that all SkyTrainers and West Coast

media feeds show active support for our mask policy Passengers feel safer and are more comfortable using transit

Hopefully this will rebuild trust with our riders in what looks like a long road to recovery

This week my agenda was further dominated by two issues Firstly there is the 2021 budget and in short there is a hole

that needs to be plugged Although we expect support from the Province we de have concerns about the longerterm

affordability of everything we are planning to do For BCRTC this means we have to navigate choppy waters trying to

find the right balance between what we need and what we want The dynamics around COVID19 added an extra layer

of complexity to what is already a complex playing field As a business we have the responsibility for three big work

packages to Get Well from years of underinvestment to maintain a state of good repair and to help deliver several

prioritize wrangly then we could be firefighting for many more years to come As you know I want to move forward

and firefighting doesnt help us be better every day

Secondly we are quickly reaching a point where we need to make decisions about the procurement of 205 new cars the

Jength of our train sets four or five cars and the supporting infrastructure and systems Once we make that decision

we are locked in and that is quite a big detision They say no guts no glory but only when it is based on a solid plan

Illegal Immigrants Cost the

State of California 3029

Billion Annually

Illegal immigrants and their children cost the

State of California a net 3029 billion per

year This equates to 7352 per illegal alien

or roughly 177 percent of Californias state

ters

While many of these costs are absorbed by the

federal and local governments the drain on

the State of California remains significant

Increasingly the question is no longer

whether California ought to give illegal

immigrants sanctuaryits whether

i

they can afford it

An officer may never stop or arrest you based on your race

thousands of Syrian refugees have

been trying to reach Europe many

attempting treacherous sea voyages

Usually more than half of any refugee

population are children Refugee

children are first and foremost children

and as children they need to have their

rights respected As refugees they are

i

particularly at risk They are more

susceptible to disease malnutrition and

physical injury They need the support

of adults not only for physical survival

but also for their psychological and

social weilbeing Children are

Pa

developing and if they miss key stages

aro

of development it can forever damage

their physical and mental wellbeing

As conflict and crises persist children

can lose their childhood We must work

together to prevent this and to ensure

respect for the rights of these children

and of all children  everywhere
