Bruce Cat

How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism

lislam lays on its votaries faithfulll Besides the fanatical

frenzy which is as dangerous in aman as hydrophobia

rabies in a dog there is this fearful fatalistic apathy

A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace

and refinement the next of its dignity and sanctity The

fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must

belong to some man as his absolute property either as

a cchild a wife or a concubine must delay the final

extinction of slavery until the faith of islam has ceased

to be a great power among men

individual Moslems may show splendid qualitiesbut

the influence of the religion paralyses the social

development of those who follow it No stronger

retrograde backward force exists in the world Far from

being moribund becoming obsolete Mohammedanism is

a militant and proselytising faith

At the time of his captivity the Field Marshal was very ill He was initially sent to a hospital and

later ended up in a generals camp at the Monastery of Saint Euthymius in Suzdal

Paulus held nationalsocialist views for a long time He considered the creation of the proSoviet

Union of German Officers to be high treason His attitude towards Nazi ideas underwent a

change after the attempt to assassinate Hitler The conspirators were brutally dealt with and

among them were friends of the Field Marshal The letter coming from his wife was the last straw

that changed his views On August 8th 1944 Paulus address to the German people was

broadcasted on the radio In it he called to save the country and to renounce Hitler He signed

antiwar leaflets with his own hand A few days later Paulus joined the Union of German Officers

and later the National Committee for a Free Germany

ad

The Nazis responded immediately to his actions

Paulus son who fought at Stalingrad as a

sw

Captain was jailed and his wife and daughter

were put under house arrest

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces

Care

Stay home when you are sick

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue then throw the tissue in the

With respect, and for reasons explained in this FB post, I disagree.

Just now Qv

Green Party leadership candidate Annamie Paul is reported to have told the

Toronto Star that concerns about the leadership contest entry fee should

fared olka a ns

With all due respect I disagree The cost of participation in the leadership

contest is so high that some candidates might not be able to participate in

the race The financial burden is particularly onerous for candidates who

have limited means and who do not have support from deeppocketed

donors This is therefore an issue that goes to the heart of what kind of a

party we want to have It is an issue that should be debated publicly with

mutual respect No leadership candidate or member of the party should be

discouraged from publicly expressing a view about the cost of participating

eM nem crsve uci smerelaL Lle

Moreover Annamies comment implies that private expressions of concern

about the entry fee are more effective than public expressions of concern

As a matter of fact before the leadership contest rules were announced I

and others privately expressed concerns to Federal Council that the fee

would be too high for some candidates and we asked Federal Council to fix

the fee at no higher than 5000 I received no response from Federal

Council to that communication and as we now know Federal Council

ultimately fixed the entry fee at a level that is ten times higher than 5000

Therefore experience has shown that keeping concerns of this nature out

of the public domain is ineffective

it actually did match a vector technology that was

published in 1998 in the proceedings of the

National Academy of Science

This vector technology is a mechanism by which

molecular biologists insert new genes into viruses

and bacteria

Now Its really unusual to find a vector technology

The survey results show 61 per cent of

respondents disagree that the

protesters blockading key

transportation corridors are conducting

justified and legitimate protests

compared to 39 per cent who said that

they believe the protests are legitimate

and justified

Its the first poll that weve ever done

on this issue lpsos Public Affairs CEO

Darrell Bricker told Global News The

first takeaway is that Canadians are not

pleased to see ports and railways

blocked

In fact they so dont agree with it that

almost half of Canadians actually

better than half 53 per cent actually

read This is regarding Trudeau Quebec and

TRUDEAUS shutdown of ALBERTA oil

Before Pierre Elliot Trudeau entered politics his

family owned Champlain Oil and the LAigle DOr

Golden Eagle gas stations in Eastern Ontario

Quebec New Brunswick and Nova Scotia Sweet

crude from Saudi Arabia was shipped to KC Irving

refineries in the Maritimes and sold through

Trudeaus firm He had to divest himself of those

t

assets into a blind trust to be in politics

Ships carrying oil from the Middle East still come to

Canada and unload at the Irving refineries for refining

Gas and fuel ail still flow from the Irving refineries

ee

Trudeau and Quebec still profit handsomely from a deal

made in Saudi Arabia That is why Trudeau and Quebec

resist building a pipeline from Western Canada to the

Maritimes Trudeau is the Prime Minister of Canada but

he resists doing what is right for Canadians but he

continues to enrich his familys portfolio

Hl

ovemc

Without a doubt these assets are still in the family porttolio

and clearly dictates how Trudeau deals in oil in Eastern

CanadaClearly bringing oil from Alberta would adversely

affect his familys income

STATEMENT

I hereby announce the end of my campaign for the

Conservative Party of Canada CPC leadership

In 2017 candidates were asked to secure 300 member

nominations as a condition of entry In 2020 the party

raised the bar tenfold to 3000 nominations The party

further demanded the first 1000 nominations by February

27th with a 21day waiting period on nomination eligibility

for new members These requirements were designed to

keep outsider candidates out They worked

offer my unconditional support in the CPC leadership race

to Rudy Husny Rudy is the only candidate who can

challenge the entitlements and prejudices of the CPC

establishment I would be pleased to help him do so

 am and will remain fiscally conservative

But there are more effective, more aggressive solutions that are now also needed to realize the needed reductions by 2030. https://t.co/8KAW4KLJ1V #ClimateCrisis #cdnpoli 2/ https://t.co/1luHooU3oO","httpswww policyalternativescapublicationsreportsheatingbackingdown

DCC RC COE LCL

For many Canadians and even for some policy analysts carbon pricing has become synonymous with

climate action Indeed the forthcoming federal election is already being framed as a referendum on

the carbon pricing backstop However placing carbon pricingspecifically the federal carbon

pricing backstop regulationat the centre of Canades climate policy dialogue introduces several risks

to a productive and inclusive transition to a zerocarbon economy

First carbon pricing is increasingly polarized along partisan lines with conservative parties typically

rejecting any form of taxation Many if not most conservative politicians in Canada have promised to

repeal or oppose carbon pricing schemes if they are elected On the other hand most conservative

voters agree that climate action is necessary and are willing to entertain other approaches to

reducing emissions Putting too much emphasis on pricing alone risks alienating large segments of

the Canadian electorate from the decarbonization conversation Although the introduction of direct

household rebates under the federal plan may have increased overall acceptance of the carbon

folitet ie ocelllon MUCH UMC LL eimai xo1Nro1k QcolasUNVol MZ RYoICRESI ols ster la

Second carbon pricing has become a battleground for provincial autonomy Few provinces have

endorsed the federal backstop policy outright and several governments of different political stripes

pe eo eM Mie MOM A iit nGo MM olemen eRe colle cle Rel emule Rkeceo

pricing systems of their own volition Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador eventually

introduced their own systems but only in response to federal pressure The rest have or will have the

federal backstop imposed either voluntarily as in Prince Edward Island or involuntarily as in Alberta

Saskatchewan Manitoba Ontario and New Brunswick Butting heads with provincial governments

that require cooperation across jurisdictions

Third although carbon pricing is the most economically efficient climate policy on the table it is

not necessarily the most effective policy option available to Canadian governments for reducing

greenhouse gas emissions In other words there are many other policies that may be more expensive

their legal status even those youth who beat che odds to attend and graduate callege face the same limited

Have you seen them

The modern day nomads arent just the folks with

bows and arrows nor daggers

Whore the modern day nomads

Theyre the joblease scorched backs wandering

the corners of the borders frantically seeking

to harvest where theyve not sown

and gulp where theyve not dug

Whore the modern day nomads2

Theyre the young dudes with nothing to satisfy

neither put atop their tables

Maybe their old wagons have preyed their

inheritance and eaten their future

Whore the modern day nomads2

Theyre those who have soid their rights

for handfuls of grains and

profess the mantra of the aristocrats

Homeowning older

Australians should pay

more for residential aged

care

CR a RM oon eee

ent LOR a

Heavily subsidised aged care services used to be

seen as a right and entitlement for all older

Australians But as aged care demand grows

and costs risey its becoming increasingly clear

the current system isnt sustainable

The family home has always been a central part

of the debate over how much older Australians

should contribute to their aged care services

But it has largely been protected from means

Coan

Its time for Australians who own their own

home to contribute more to the cost of their

aged care and there are fair and equitable

ways to go about this

Soccer Boots for Refugees

Wallsend MP Sonia Hornery is asking people to donate old soccer boots to

dot eN exec NO Couto eC HNIC RA y eeneT iM mice cee Meroe

The Development and Relief Agency DARA a registered charity of the

Catholic Diocese of MaitlandNewcastle is collecting soccer boots ina

decent condition that arent being used

It will donate them to children of local refugee families

Ms Hornerys office in Nelson Street Wallsend is an official dropoff

point for any clubs or individuals who have boots to donate

The Wallsend electorate has many proud football clubs I am asking these

clubs to join me in supporting this great initiative Ms Hornery said

Getting involved in sport can be expensive but we know the benefits

Co eV itl come m icone sei Claris e1E coca Ct Ee MeL sleta or ees ra

The inability to afford the costs of sport could prevent local refugee families

who are often isolated from being connected to others through sport

The simple act of donating boots unlocks multiple avenues and allows them

to be involved within the sport generating new opportunities for friendships

and community spirit she said
