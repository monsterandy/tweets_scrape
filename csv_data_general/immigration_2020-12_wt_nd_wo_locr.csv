Re Income Security for Canadi

Subject Re Income Security for Canadians

Thank you for taking the time to respond to me I

truly appreciate it Let me just start with saying

that am grateful for the social and economic

benefits that Canadians have been receiving I feel

incredibly fortunate to live in Canada and 1

applaud our response to this pandemic My

concern is that some of the most vulnerable

people in our society may be getting left behind

have helped us offset the economic costs of a

UBI This is uncharted territory which I believe

most comprehensive relief possible in a political

climate where so many people have differing and

contradictory views on economic and social

issues As someone who works in the service

Environment Minister Catherine McKenna says her governments

climate strategy including the federal carbon tax provisions will

stay the course

She dismissed claims by Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre that the

government would stretch its promised 50 per tonne price cap by

2022 if reelected this fall

This after a Globe and Mail interview with McKenna published

Sunday indicated that the minister was wavering on her decision

to raise the levy She said that while the government had no

immediate plans to walk back their pledge any future

amendments would be made in consultation with provinces and

Canadians at large

Our position has not changed she said speaking to reporters at a

green jobs announcement on Monday Mr Pierre Poilievre does

press conferences all the time most of the time misleading

With my billions of dollars I control governments

media and health organizations around the world

want to inject humanity with a vaccine for covid19

that will change your DNA

I told the world before that want to reduce mankind

with 15 using vaccines The past years I already

destroyed millions with my toxic vaccines

Thats why over 600000 people signed a petition

to prosecute me for my crimes against humanity

How am I able to get away with all of this

Because you think this is a dumb conspiracy theory

Your ignorance is my greatest weapon

My greatest fear7 That you would wake up

theorgonizedearth More than a hundred years ago Rudolf

Steiner wrote the following

In the future we will eliminate the soul with medicine

Under the pretext of a heaithy point of view there will be a

vaccine by which the human body will be treated as soon

as possible directly at birth so that the human being

cannot develop the thought of the existence of soul and

Spirit

To materialistic doctors will be entrusted the task of

temoving the soul of humanity As today people are

vaccinated against this disease or that disease so in the

future children will be vaccinated with a substance that

can be produced precisely in such a way that people

x

thanks to this vaccination will be immune to being

subjected to the madness of spiritual life

He would be extremely smart but he would not develop a

conscience and that is the true goal of some materialistic

circles

fy

With such a vaccine you can easily make the etheric body

loose in the physical body

Once the etheric body is detached the relationship

between the universe and the etheric body would become

extremely unstable and man would become an automaton

for the physicai body of man must be polished on this Earth

by spiritual will

So the vaccine becomes a kind of arymanique force man

can no longer get rid of a given materialistic feeling He

becomes materialistic of constitution and can no longer

rise to the spiritual

Weeks before the holidays the CRA has instructed people who applied for CERB

in good faith to repay the benefit in full up to 14000 in some cases by

December 3ist

These are struggling smallbusiness owners and selfemployed people who

made less than 5000 a year before the pandemic They do not have 14000

Erin O Toole draws criticism for saying residential

schools were created to provide education

The Conservative Party of Canada leader is receiving criticism for remarks he

made in a video posted to the Ryerson Conservatives club Facebook page in

November Speaking about the history of Canadas residential school system

OToole said the schools were set up to try and provide education and became

horrible In 2008 Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper acknowledged

residential schools in Canada were set up with the specific goal of assimilating

Indigenous children On Tuesday OToole told Global News that he takes the

horrific history of residential schools very seriously

Those employed in the PMO on this day

All saw the moment Guy broke character

Midway through his prepared monologue

He added a sentence of offthecuff snark

The army of privileged imbeciles hed hired

May not have caught the verbal significance

I believe in that moment Guy had been rattled

By the unblinking stare he was seeing from me

Whatever the motivation hed exposed his truth

IMMIGRATION SOLUTIONS

Canada eases eligibility

requirements for Rural and

Northern Immigration Pilot

Applicants no longer need to have accumulated work experience over

a continuous period of time Instead Canada will count the work

experience requirement if it was completed within the three years

preceding the application One year of eligible work experience is still

required for the program but having breaks in employment does not

make someone ineligible for the program This applies to all who have

already applied for the pilot as well as those who apply in the future

https://t.co/FX8cZyeqpA

#msm #criticism #propaganda #anticap #liberals #democrats https://t.co/nSSjgbYuCP","To be clear a significant portion of this criticism is also coming from a combative contrarian online left and

is often spearheaded by exlibertarian windbags that I myself consider at least somewhat reactionary from an

ideological perspective With advance apologies for generalizing the positions of multiple independent

pundits into a single amalgamated argument these people essentially start from a similar line of reasoning to

Robins that Trumps failure to establish a dictatorship means he isnt a fascist and add the theory that calling

Trump and Trumpism fascist is merely hysterical liberal scaremongering designed to cow the left into

supporting a neoliberal agenda Of course adopting this position once again requires one to selectively forget

that it was Trump not the Democratic Party that brought a bunch of confirmed white nationalists into

government ordered DHS to start black bagging protesters in the street like they were terrorists and called

neonazi rioters a fascist street gang and the reactionary QAnon conspiracy cult fine upstanding Americans

essentially 1 mean at the point that youre arguing concentration camps for babies forced sterilizations of

migrant women and sending the fcking army to the border to fight a fake war against a migrant caravan

Mena akar CeCe e alent Liam Ce ea w Lael eee Cia cok alm er lean

uncomfortably said Black Lives Matter is basically the reaffascism why should any reasonable person take

anything you say about fascism seriously at all

So be it then perhaps we can just ignore sketchy apologists for reactionary

cops like Lee Fang Matt Taibbi or Zaid Jilani among others because even if

few of them would admit it its readily apparent that on some level most of

i

the people in this larger ideological circle have long been committed to the

ideas that woke corporate neoliberalism is the primary enemy of the left

and that acknowledging Trumps fascism merely makes it easier for sht tier

radical centrists to dominate the political landscape Maybe we just

shouldnt be relying on people who think imaginary cancel culture is the

ORC aL ate Reka aca R te eae ate cea

evidence is there that cardcarrying members of the Nagle Caucus like Aimee Terese the hosts of the Red

Scare Podcast and rstupidpol forum chuds know anything about fascism at all and given how poorly they all

seem to understand the left why would you trust their opinions on any given subject anyway7 Maybe its time

we stop listening to emotional arguments from the Glenn Greenwalds Matt Stollers and Caitlin Johnstones of

the world when it comes to the subject of what is and isnt a fascist because hanestly when you strip away the

righteous indignation its pretty clear that most of these folks are exRon Paulloving libertarian rejects

pushing a leftright populist alliance against the system that has jong since been discredited as a successful

strategy and furthermore given the intellect of the people disseminating these arguments its fair to say

theyre probably not doing so from a position of sincerity and good faith discussion

Refugees as central dialogue partners for

displacement solutions

AY

Over the past decades the UNHCR and international governments

have engaged in ongoing discussions around refugee protection

From the Refugee Convention to domestic legal frameworks and

prograrmming there have been a plethora of advances to improve

the lives of refugees

Unfortunately despite good intentions refugees are seldom

engaged with directly to understand their needs The inclusion of

refugee voices into policy debates is the only ethical way to engage

such an affected population Moreover such inclusion will imprave

the effectiveness of policy irnplementation thereby enhancing the

intelligence of policy and institutional design
