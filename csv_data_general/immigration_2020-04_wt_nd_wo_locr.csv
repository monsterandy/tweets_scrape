Read my statement and then answer this brief survey to let me know if you agree that it's time to rethink our relationship with China. https://t.co/5Tw4rgzmQb #cpcldr #cdnpoli https://t.co/AOsRUwVlYp,"THE CURRENT COVID19 CRISIS IS

A TERRIBLE WAKE UP CALL FOR CANADA

We left ourselves vulnerable to a totalitarian regime that deceived us and the world to the manifestation

and migration of the virus

Our government has blindly followed the data from China and has responded with measures that are

consistently too little too late We let China be responsible for half the weorlds production of swabs

gowns masks ventilators and other essential medical equipment which has resulted in Canada and our

allies arguing over a limited amount of supplies

Trusting China and the World Health Organization WHO and our own misplaced trust logic reasoning

and pride has escalated the COVID19 crisis we are now facing today This fact has been confirmed now

that the belated modelling is finally coming out

CANADAS GOVERNMENT HAS LET US DOWN

We should be following democracies like Israel South Korea Taiwan and Hong Kong who have flattened

the curve dramatically by having a secure supply of all medical and protective equipment They have

pursued their own national interest and developed a protocol based on testing contact tracing isolation

and containment and in many cases universal facemask use

We need to totally rethink what is in the best interest of Canada when it comes to trade and the security

of essential supplies The Communist Party of China cannot be trusted as their only objective is world

domination through adversarial trade practices that compromise other nations sovereignty and national

security The people of China themselves are victims in the games of the Communist Party and their

ability to thrive in the face of a ruthless regime should inspire us to stand up to

idaloRO al laccome leh eal ae lalate

As leader in light of the crisis in which we now find ourselves will

Be

restructure our trade priorities international relationships and define and

determine our course forward with the safety and security of Canadians as

read This is regarding Trudeau Quebec and

TRUDEAUS shutdown of ALBERTA oil

Before Pierre Elliot Trudeau entered politics his

family owned Champlain Oil and the LAigle DOr

Golden Eagle gas stations in Eastern Ontario

Quebec New Brunswick and Nova Scotia Sweet

crude from Saudi Arabia was shipped to KC Irving

ye

refineries in the Maritimes and sold through

Trudeaus firm He had to divest himself of those

assets into a blind trust to be in politics

Ships carrying oil from the Middle East still come to

Canada and unload at the Irving refineries for refining

aw

Gas and fuel oil still flow from the Irving refineries

Trudeau and Quebec still profit handsomely from a deal

made in Saudi Arabia That is why Trudeau and Quebec

resist building a pipeline from Western Canada to the

Maritimes Trudeau is the Prime Minister of Canada but

he resists doing what is right for Canadians but he

eucmc

continues to enrich his familys portfolio

Without a doubt these assets are still in the tamily porttolio

and clearly dictates how Trudeau deals in oil in Eastern

CanadaClearly bringing oil from Alberta would adversely

affect his familys income

Thank you Mr Chair

Once again I am a little surprised I am

here more to talk about public safety

Around the world

countries

like the

United States Australia and others have

been taking major steps to keep the

situation under control As I understand

it we are starting to take some steps

here but first we have to get papers out

of boxes and to reactivate protocols in

order to

remember

how to put the

Quarantine Act into effect

Can you explain to me why everything

takes so long in Canada After all there

were

recommendations

in

the 2003

report on SARS

Ms Namiesniowski could you explain to

me why things are not moving quickly2

Iceland focused on response times as a the primary tool to stay ahead of the curve

Their responsiveness has paid off by preventing transmission

After ther first few imported cases were confirmed Iceland immediately issued

quarantine measures for all travelers returning from Italy In the subsequent week

quarantines were expanded until all arrivals to Iceland had to quarantine for 14 days

Iceland declared a state of emergency after the first two communitytransmitted

infections were confirmed

This was done to ensure government bodies improved their preparedness

The country quicly closed universities and junior colleges on March 13 In addition

they banned gatherings of more than 100 people on March 16

Citizens of most nations find it impossible to get a coronavirus test unless youre

already very infected Iceland on the other hand tests anybody who requests the

tests Widespread 8 robust testing program has been the primary tool to the

countrys low number of infections and deaths

There are only 1727 people infected

Only eight have died or a 05 death rate

COVID19s real death rate is likely close to this number which means in most

countries the true infection rate is much higher

Using Iceland as the model here are some possible infection numbers for other

countries

Canada 1010 deaths translates to 202000 infections

My VOICE is on behalf of my spouse who has a diagnosis of young onset Alzheimers disease He Is not elderly

yet he isin care Respite care and lack of proper training and staffing there resulted in admission to emergency

at the hospital while I was recovering fram surgery John waited in the hospital without adequate dementia

care for 355 days before finding a place in long term care That in itself is another problem with long term care

Respite care is part of the nursing home sectorl could provide many stories and photos of the lack of care have

witnessed However I think the current news stories should be sufficient to motivate all levels of government

Porat am

In spite of the statements above there are wonderful staff working in facilties They love their jobs and the

residents for which they care We need them to all want to be there to provide care The staff need more targeted

training in dementia care as the largest portion of residents are impacted by dementia The care aides who do

the hardest most intimate care need to be recognized with better hours and a decent wage that allows them

a good quality of life They need benefits This would decrease the need to work more than one job or different

facilties Providing them with benefits better pay and full time positions would in turn provide consistent care

In closing would invite you to stay in a nursing home for a few days to truly experience what our families are

the

27th British

Commonwealth Brigade made up of Australian

Canadian and New Zealand troops faced the Chinese

Peoples Volunteer Army in the Kapyong Valley

The brigade was heavily outnumbered by the PVA but

held their position through three days of fighting

The Princess Patricias Canadian Light

Infantry

defended Hill 677 against the Chinese who were

unable to remove the Canadians after a fierce night

of fighting

The actions in this battle would help prevent a

breakthrough in the line by Chinese which would

have opened up Seoul for capture

The Canadian troops would see 10 soldiers killed and

23 wounded in the battle

In Canada and Australia the battle is honoured every

April 24 as Kapyong Day

NEWS

Federal provincial and territorial governments have

agreed that in advance of reopening a region needs to

demonstrate

the ability to contain COVIDI9 transmission to a

level the health system can manage including

stabilizing the number of hospitalizations and new

cases

that sufficient capacity is in place to test trace

and isolate the virus so when for example someone

around you tests positive you will be notified quickly

so you can isolate

the health systerms ability to support both

COVIDI9 and non COVIDI9 patients has been

expanded including making sure there is enough

medications and supplies to go around

that there are additional protections in place for

vulnerable groups communities and key populations

such as longterm care homes and in jails or shelters

that workplace protocols are in place and are

being monitored to prevent the spread of COVID19

when people do return to their jobs such as

providing personal protective equipment for workers

who cant maintain physical distancing

the easing of restrictions on nonessential travel

in acoordinated manner to avoid the risk of

importing the virus through domestic travel and

seeing to it that communities are able to manage

localized outbreaks including within schools or on

public transit

For legislation to be put in place to protect the

Canadian people from politicians who break the law

indulge in unethical practices who take advantage

of their office and power to hide the truth

There needs to be a body put in place who can

Moreover sanctions that will remove from office

The Time Has Come

For legislation to be put in place to protect the

Canadian people from politicians who break the law

indulge in unethical practices who take advantage

of their office and power to hide the truth

There needs to be a body put in place who can

investigate without interference such practices

Moreover sanctions that will remove from office

those politicians who have practiced in bad faith and

broken the trust of the People
