Unfortunately we were banned from our US visa due to the unjust Presidential Proclamation

PP 9645 in the previous US Administration which targeted Iranian nationality and our reli

This has caused us a lot of frustrations and sadness Some of us had traveled to other countries

and have even put our lives and careers on pause in order to obtain proper documentation for

CC Vice President Mrs Kamela Harris House Representatives US Senate

We Iranians who were the winners of the Diversity Lottery for the years 2017 2020

are requesting your reconsideration for a second chance to process our cases

We have been Invited for interviews by the US immigration entity and have accepted all

costs including medical and travel expenses in hopes of living in the democratic

country of the USA and achieving prosperity

Unfortunately we were banned from our US visa due to the unjust Presidential

Proclamation PP 9645 in the previous US Administration which targeted Iranian

nationality and our religion This has caused us a lot of frustrations and sadness Some

of us had traveled to other countries and have even put our lives and careers on pause

in order to obtain proper documentation for this lottery Our children were so excited to

grow up in America and to obtain a strong education an only chance for a lot of them

President and Vice President we hope that you consider our cases We indude many

professional individuals among the winners of the diversity lottery  architects

doctors researchers etc We believe that we can be highly productive members of the

American society and further strengthen the economy given the chance

We appreciate your timely action on this issue

Respectfully

Awaiting Iranian Lottery winners

CC Vice President Mrs Kamela Harris House Representatives US Senate

We Iranians who were the winners of the Diversity Lottery for the years 2017  202C

are requesting your reconsideration for a second chance to process our cases

We have been invited for interviews by the US immigration entity and have accepted all

costs including medical and travel expenses in hopes of living in the democratic

country of the USA and achieving prosperity

Unfortunately we were banned from our US visa due to the unjust Presidential

Proclamation PP 9645 in the previous US Administration which targeted Iranian

nationality and our religion This has caused us a lot of frustrations and sadness Some

of us had traveled to other countries and have even put our lives and careers on pause

in order to obtain proper documentation for this lottery Our children were so excited tc

grow up in America and to obtain a strong education an only chance for a lot of them

President and Vice President we hope that you consider our cases We include many

professional individuals among the winners of the diversity lottery  architects

doctors researchers etc We believe that we can be highly productive members of the

American society and further strengthen the economy given the chance

We appreciate your timely action on this issue

Respectfully

Awaiting Iranian Lottery winners

Kindness cures envy by placing the desire to help others

Temperance cures gluttony by implanting the desire to

be healthy therefore making one fit to serve others

Charity or love cures greed by putting the desire to help

others above storing up treasure for ones self

Chastity or selfcontrol cures lust by controlling passion

and leveraging that energy for the good of others

Humility cures pride by removing ones ego and

boastfulness therefore allowing the attitude of service

DID INDEED DECREASE MIDDLE CLASS Bry Saeed

INCREASING THE SHARE THAT THE WEALTHY PAID

by Kevin Ryan

When President Trump and Republicans ferers te NCU at 101 R08 Oc

pias Ae eR left and many in the media ES email

increase the tax burden on the working class and decrease fiaetamal

wealthy

Well data is finally out and it turns out the opposite is tue itor hs

ORONC Ree Cen emAne ce SCR UICC R Acs

Per NARs erent CL ORE oo SS aL Pvreyg iT tech

The IRS data shows that the top 1 paid 401 of all income taxes

aiter the tax reform went into effect Thats an INCREASE from the

year before when they paid 385 and its the highest share that the

1 had paid since data began being recorded forty years ago

The bottom 50 of earners on the other hand with adjusted gross

fatsel ats cMeha CR UTS Ros MES Om US Oe re CS

fall from 31 in 2017 to 29 in 2018

In other words the Trump tax cuts increased the share paid by the

wealthy and decreased the share paid by the middle class

Also the share of income earned by the middle class went up while

the share earned by the wealthy went down

The bill did this by doubiing the standard deduction and expanded the

child tax credit while lowering tax rates for nearly everyone

Despite the rhetoric at the time Nancy Pelosi said it was the worst bill

ever and Chuck Schumer said Its completely focused on the wealthy

and the powerful not the middle class one person did accurately

predict what the bill would do

One of the best comments I saw online was

from someone in the Yahoo News comments

section who said that Trump reminded him

you that you need to lose 100 pounds and

you came up with 10 reasons why hes crazy

and then you finally realize that hes the only

one telling you the truth

the two Canadians detained in China

unjustly Michael Kovrig and Michael

Spavor have spent a long time in detention in China

We think of their families we think of their

communities We think of their loved ones but we

also stay focused on them as we have over the past

Wiel a

We have continued to engage directly including

myself directly with President Xi to highlight how

important it is to bring these Car ians home We

will continue to work very hard as I know ail

Canadians will to send that clear message that

those Canadians must be returned home

already is pushing his main campaign theme which as he told the Stars

editorial board is that the Conservatives are the best party to get our

For the NDP its strategy is to unveil campaign promises early and to portray

opponents as followers not leaders Singh kicked off the partys unofficial

platform this week by calling for the elimination of forprofit longtermcare

facilities by 2030

Let me hurt some feelings while I have a minutel

No one owes you are your family anything nor is it the local

governments responsibility to support you during trying times like

thist Sink or swim its your choice The City and County along with

power providers or any other service owes you NOTHING Im sick

and tired of people looking for a damn handout if you dont have

electricity you step up and come up with a game plan to keep your

family warm and safe If you have no water you deal without and

think outside of the box to survive and supply water to your family

Hf you are sitting at home in the cold because you have no power

and are sitting there waiting for someone to come rescue you

because your lazy is direct result of your raising Only the strong

will survive and the weak will parish Folks God has given us the

tools to support ourselves in times like this This is sadly a product

of a socialist government where they feed people to believe that the

FEW will work and others will become dependent for handouts Am

sorry that you have been dealing without electricity and water yes

But Ill be damned if Im going to provide for anyone that is capable

of doing it themseives We have lost sight of those in need and

those that take advantage of the system and meshed them in to

one group Bottom line quit crying and looking for a handout Get

off your ass and take care of your own family

Bottom lineDONT A PART OF PROBLEM BE A PART OF THE

SOLUTION

CVV PAW AE

PULARN

Shared Services Canada the governments central agency for building

and operating the governments electronic backbone on behalf of most

departments did less well at consulting in Hogans estimation The

auditor general was critical of SSCs failure to consult with its biggest

client the Department of National Defence until very late in a project

designed to consolidate telecommunications technologies

STORY CONTINUES BELOW

aia

eo

Z

In order to incorporate the defence departments requirements SSC has

had to develop costly revisions to the project to be delivered through

separate contracts Because technical support from the original vendor

for the departments old phone system ended three years ago the military

has experienced outages and other technical issues at more than a dozen

bases and other installations

The auditor general also pointed out the procurement agencies had done a

poor job teaching its employees about the new era of agile procurement

Upon their appointment federal procurement employees are expected to

finish six courses at the Canadian School of Public Service Hogans team

of auditors examined the six courses and discovered none included topics

directly relevant to large and complex IT projects

tired of berating readers of the Daily Mail the campaign group Stop Funding Hate SFH has told its followers to contact businesses

demanding that they refuse to advertise on the new and yettogolive news station GB News The new station boasts Andrew Neil as its

chairman and prime presenter alongside Dan Wootton from the Sun Comparisons have been made between it and Fox News contrary to

popular opinion its not funded by Rupert Murdoch he has his own thing going on while some have taken issue with the fact that one of it

key funders Sir Paul Marshall was a Brexit supporter The channets main backer is actually the USbased Discovery a factual

entertainment behemoth not exactly know for courting controversy Given the channel hasnt hit the airwaves yet the only credible

comparison between it and Fox News is the format Neil has announced that it will feature programming built around strong presenters

which becomes an appointment to view rather than the rollingnews style of BBC or Sky News But since when does anyone wait to see the

show before they slate it these days2 In a column used by SFH as an example of the alleged hatefulness of GB News Marina Hyde warned of

view of how publics interact with news seemingly forgetting that Biden won not Trump despite Fox News remaining on air the most

troublesome point argued by Guardian journalists and SFH active ists alike is about impartiality Hyde called GB News an antiimpartiality

news channel a claim which was strongly refuted by Neil who wrote a letter in reply to the article which the Guardian refused to publish

so much for a commitment to an unbiased representation of the news SFH is gleefully circulating a headline from Neil arguing that GB

News wont be woke alongside a dictionary definition of woke as wellinformed and uptodate Perhaps such groups should look up
