withdrawals

now penaltyfree

Ordinarily IRA account holders who

withdraw money before age 597 must

pay a 10 penalty But these arent ordinary times Under the

new CARES Act those adversely affected by COVID19 can

take a penaltyfree hardship distribution of up to 100000

from their IRA regardless of age

Of course penaltyfree doesnt mean taxfree If you dont

repay the amount you withdraw within three years youll

generally owe income tax on the distribution

impermissible forms of congressional aggrandizement with respect to

laws only by enacting a new statute in accordance with the

requirements of bicameralism and presentment prescribed in

Award 10000 SBA Emergency EIDL Grants as Intended

Under the CARES Act Emergency EIDL Grants were to be made in amounts of up to 10000 within

three days of receiving an application However SBA has taken much longer to disburse funds to

UR oe Mai ote eos Ren PACH re On Meas Micke ul ewm OOS menace han

these awards permitting businesses to claim just 1000 per employee This means that currently a

De BUS Ome RS ECH Ne mim SURO DAR Crem tea Oh ite ee coke R Ue it

10000 allowed under the statute When SBA chose to place arbitrary limitations on award amounts

and ration available funding rather than request a new appropriation as it was willing to do for PPP it

failed small businesses and small private nonprofits that had counted on these funds

With the new 10 billion in funding for Emergency EIDL Grants that the interim COVID19 act

provides the Administration should remove the limitations it imposed that prevents businesses from

receiving a full 10000 grant Businesses that have previously received reduced grants because they

have fewer than ten employees should receive the full amount and going forward new recipients

should reccive full awards as well regardless of their size Furthermore to prevent the Administration

from once again refusing to request additional appropriations when the program is fully subscribed

SBA should notify Congress as soon as funds begin to run low rather than cut the amount small

businesses receive In addition it should dedicate the resources it has received for administrative

expenses to ensure that loans go out within the statutorily mandated threeday time frame

Conservatives Are Destroying Our

Future

Yesterday at 1202 PM

Dear Progressives

Destroying Joe Biden will not get you what you

want Bernie will never become the nominee

The party will nominate someone else If you

damage Joe Bidens candidacy we will go to a

contested convention where the party will then

nominate someone who isnt Joe Biden or Bernie

Sanders So this last ditch effort to win the

nomination for Bernie will never work Also

trying to dirty Biden to help Sanders could

backfire in the worst possible outcome Four

more years of Donald Trump 2
