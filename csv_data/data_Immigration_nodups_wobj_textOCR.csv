STATEMENT OF ACTING U.S. ATTORNEY AUDREY STRAUSS

‚ÄúAs alleged, the defendants defrauded hundreds of thousands

of donors, capitalizing on theirinterest in funding a border wall

toraise millions of dollars, under the false pretense that all of

that money would be spent on construction. While repeatedly

Peo

ag

assuring donors that Brian Kolfage, the founder and public face

of We Build the Wall, would not be paid a cent, the defendants

w

secretly schemed to pass hundreds of thousands of dollars to

Kolfage, which he used to fund his lavish lifestyle. We thank

the USPIS for their partnership in investigating this case, and

}>

we remain dedicated to rooting out and prosecuting fraud

wherever we find it.‚Äù

The Pirbright Institute is a biological

research organization based in Surrey,

England. The organization specializes in

studying animal viruses and zoonotic

diseases that transfer from animals to

people. While the institute does hold a

patent for a coronavirus that primarily

affects chickens, it does not hold a

patent on any part of the novel

coronavirus causing the current COVID-

19 pandemic.

‚ÄúThe Institute was granted a patent in

2018 which covers the development of an

attenuated (weakened) form of the

coronavirus that could potentially be

used as a vaccine to prevent respiratory

diseases in birds, including IBV, and

other animals,"" a representative from the

Pirbright Institute told USA TODAY.

So in her speech yesterday Kamaia Harris

essentially stated that if elected president

she: Will take your guns away. Will take

your doctor of choice away.

Will take your free market & the American

dream away - by putting a cap on how

successful and how much money you're

allowed to make. Will take your car of

choice away. Will take your/our wall,

sovereignty and security away.

Cool, let's vote for her!

Said nobody with a brain.

The idea that some lives maiter less is

as

na

the root of aff that is wrang with the

word."" Paul Farmer

ei

a

Globally, ane in every 122 humans is

now either a refugee, internally

¬¢¬∞

displaced, or seeking asylum. If this

were the population of a country, it

2

would ba the world's 24th biggest. This

Sy

has been a result of years of ongoing

4

-‚Äî

conflict and suffering. Many aid

y<

oe

agencies are running out of money to

be .

fa

‚Äòsupport the growing numbers. The

aN.

4

World Food Programme cut food ai

al

half for Syrian refugees in neighbouring

countries. Syria's neighbours have

7

Bien

taken the vast majority of people fleeing

conflict. With conditions worsening,

&

thousands of Syrian refugees have

been trying to reach Europe, many

attempting treacherous sea voyages.

Usually more than half of any refugee

population are children. Refugee

children are first and foremost children,

and as children, they need to have their

rights respected. As refugees, they are

particularly at risk. They are more

susceptible to disease, malnutrition and

physical injury. They need the support

of adults, not only for physical survival,

but also for their psychological and

social well-being. Children are

aol

developing and if they miss key stages

aro

ne

of development it can forever damage

their physical and mental well-being.

As conflict and crises persist children

can lose their childhood. We must work

together to prevent this and to ensure

respect for the rights of these children -

and of all children - everywhere.

Is your father a member of a satanic order? And would

When an unsuspecting care worker stumbles across a plan

One of the factors that helped the Nazis rise to power was

propaganda. The Nazis used propaganda throughout the

late 1920‚Äôs and early 1930‚Äôs to boost Hitler's image, and, as

popular. In this image, Hitler can be seen crowded around

by a group of young men

situation closely and urge everybody not to take any risks and remain vigilant. The Provincial government puts a lot of

emphasis on self-discipline and one‚Äôs personal sense of responsibility. | trust that all SkyTrainers and West Coast

media feeds show active support for our mask policy. Passengers feel safer and are more comfortable using transit.

Hopefully, this will rebuild trust with our riders in what looks like a long road to recovery.

This week my agenda was further dominated by two issues, Firstly, there is the 2021 budget and in short, there is a hole

that needs to be plugged. Although we expect support from the Province, we de have concerns about the longer-term

affordability of everything we are planning to do. For BCRTC this means we have to navigate choppy waters, trying to

find the right balance between what we need and what we want, The dynamics around COVID-19 added an extra layer

of complexity to what is already a complex playing field. As a business, we have the responsibility for three big work

packages: to Get Well from years of underinvestment, to maintain a state of good repair, and to help deliver several

and firefighting doesn‚Äôt help us be better every day

Secondly, we are quickly reaching a point where we need to make decisions about the procurement of 205 new cars, the

Jength of our train sets (four or five cars) and the supporting infrastructure and systems, Once we make that decision,

we are locked in and that is quite a big decision. They say, ‚Äòno guts no glory‚Äù, but only when it is based on a solid plan.

If anybody has buyers remorse, they weren't listening closely, or at all. They bought a pig in a poke. Now, everybody is stuck with this poor excuse. Standard tail-light guarantee always expires once off the lot. 

A problem well put is half solved.

Mohanad AI-Ali is desperate to get his family into B.C. Housing.

He lives with his expecting wife and two young sons ina

cockroach-infested apartment in Burnaby's Edmonds area.

Photograph By JENNIFER MOREAU

An amber cockroach scurries across the wall in

Mohanad AI-Ani‚Äôs one bedroom Burnaby apartment,

where he lives with his wife and two sons.

The 39-year-old father shrugs it off. What can he do?

There are rats, too, he says, speaking through an

interpreter. But they seem to be the least of his

worries. Al-Ani just wants a new home so one of his

sons can have his own room, and the desperate father

is at his wits‚Äô end.

PRESS RELEASE: RightNow congratulates new

Conservative Party of Canada leader Erin O'Toole.

‚ÄúAt the beginning of the campaign it was generally

accepted in the media that Peter MacKay was going to

be coronated, so it is impressive that Erin and his team

were able to secure this victory. Given that a record

number of members cast a ballot in the largest-ever

leadership race in Canadian history, as well as how

well our endorsed candidate Leslyn Lewis did, it is

abundantly clear that social conservatives are not the

cu albatross‚Äô they were said to have been.‚Äù

Have you never signed a petition in a constituency office? They all ask for the same information. It legitimizes the petition.

NDP collecting voter info (data

mining) in form of petition supporting

Basic Income

Petitions should be done through

#HOC

Instead MP Leah Gazan urge

supporters to sign petition

1) Filling out form on her website

2) Info probably goes in database

3) Info could be used by NDP

Exactly why i | never put you on

McKenna? She deserves to be yelled

at by Canadian's. She is a big! part

of the Liberal corruption. Are you a

conservative fighting for Canadian's?

Or a closet Liberal?

a Peter MacKay @ @PeterMacKay - 4d

This is abhorrent behaviour that no one deserves.

People who enter public service do so to serve. We

will disagree passionately on occasion. But

democracy and decency demand that we do it with

civility and respect. twitter.com/cathmckenna/st...

OVERVIEW

hl

Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) is a Palestinian-led

movement for freedom, justice and equality. BDS upholds the

bl

simple principle that Palestinians are entitled to the same

Big j

rights as the rest of humanity.

ie,

Israel is occupying and colonising Palestinian land,

f

discriminating against Palestinian citizens of Israel and

denying Palestinian refugees the right to return to their

homes. Inspired by the South African anti-apartheid

movement, the BDS call urges action to pressure Israel to

What's the angle? #cdnpoli https://t.co/0Pzi4bp1QN https://t.co/y4Ds7u1qjf","While no one knows how the information leaked out of the Conservative Fund, it

appears we do know who told Ottawa's top journalists about it.

According to Maclean's , Stephen Harper's former communications director Kory

Teneycke gossiped about Scheer's private school expenses at a retirement party in

Ottawa for CTV‚Äôs Don Martin.

Maclean's also reported Teneycke tipped off the Globe and Mail's Robert Fife, who

later broke the blockbuster story .

Only a few weeks earlier, Teneycke founded a new political group calling itself

‚ÄúConservative Victory.‚Äù

Corporate records show the group's two other directors are Jeff Ballingall, founder

of Ontario Proud and Canada Proud, and John Reynolds, a former Conservative MP

who co-chaired Harper's 2006 leadership campaign. The group's registered address is

located at the Bay Street office of Fasken, a corporate law firm whose partners

notably include Guy Giorno , Harper's former Chief of Staff.

he became a frontier editor and first mayor of Weyburn, Sask

in 1912 Tom remained a gallery man for life with columns

published from Victoria to Halifax. As a WWI correspondent fo1

the Montreal Gazette he was a passionate advocate of the

Hello:

Tam writing to inform you of Ms. Katie Telford's decision to voluntarily put in place a conflict of interest screen as a result of a new position held by her husband, Mr. Rob Silver, Ms, Silver has

accepted the position of Senior Director, Corporate Strategic Initiatives & Public Affairs at MCAP which, according to its website, is a Canadian independent mortgage financing company,

The Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner has advised that no conflict screen is required in the circumstances. However, out of an abundance of caution, Ms. Telford has decided

to implement a voluntary sereen to ensure that she is not exposed to any real or perceived conflict of interest. If you have any questions with respect to the application or scope of the screen, please

communicate with the Deputy Clerk, Catherine Blewett, who has accepted to be its administrator. Note that matters, if any, which Ms. Telford will be screened out must be referred to Marci

Surkes, Executive Director of Policy and Cabinet Affairs.

‚ÄòWe are requesting your diligent cooperation in applying the voluntary screea and ensuring that Ms. Telford is abstained from any participation in any matters or decisions relating to MCAP.

Other matters that may arise could be added, for which you would be notified,

In addition, if a matter does come to Ms. Telford‚Äôs attention involving MCAP that could further her husband‚Äôs private interest, note that she is required to recuse herself and contact the Office of the

Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner to report the recusal within 60 days that the recusal took place,

Some of the Green leadership

candidates are making promises for

things that are 100 % provincial

responsibilities, dramatically

increase costs & yet they provide no

explanation of how they would pay

for or implement them. We need

serious solutions that are funded and
